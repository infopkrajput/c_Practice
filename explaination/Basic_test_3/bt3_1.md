Let's walk through the code step by step to understand how it works and what the output will be.

### Code Breakdown

1. **Variable Initialization in `main`:**
   ```c
   int c, *b, **a;
   c = 4;
   b = &c;
   a = &b;
   ```
   - `c` is an integer variable initialized to `4`.
   - `b` is a pointer to an integer and is assigned the address of `c`.
   - `a` is a pointer to a pointer to an integer and is assigned the address of `b`.

2. **Function Call:**
   ```c
   printf("%d\n", f(c, b, a));
   ```
   - The function `f` is called with the following arguments:
     - `x = c = 4`
     - `py = b = &c`
     - `ppz = a = &b`

3. **Inside the Function `f`:**
   ```c
   int f(int x, int *py, int **ppz)
   {
       int y, z;
       **ppz += 1;
       z = **ppz;
       *py += 2;
       y = *py;
       x += 3;
       return x + y + z;
   }
   ```
   - The function `f` has local variables `y` and `z`.

   **Step-by-Step Execution:**
   
   - `**ppz += 1;`
     - `**ppz` means `**a`, which is `*b`, and `*b` is `c`.
     - `c` is incremented by `1`, so `c` becomes `5`.
   
   - `z = **ppz;`
     - Again, `**ppz` is `*b`, which is `c`.
     - Since `c` is now `5`, `z` is assigned the value `5`.

   - `*py += 2;`
     - `*py` is `*b`, which is `c`.
     - `c` is incremented by `2`, so `c` becomes `7`.
   
   - `y = *py;`
     - `y` is assigned the value of `*py`, which is `7` (the current value of `c`).

   - `x += 3;`
     - `x` was originally `4`, so `x` becomes `7` after adding `3`.

   - `return x + y + z;`
     - The function returns the sum of `x`, `y`, and `z`, which is `7 + 7 + 5 = 19`.

### Final Output:
The output of the program is:

```
19
```

This output results from summing the modified values of `x`, `y`, and `z` as calculated inside the function `f`.
