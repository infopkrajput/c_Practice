Let's analyze the given C program step by step to determine what the output will be:

### Code Breakdown

1. **Variable Initialization:**
   ```c
   int ***r, **q, *p, i = 8;
   ```
   - `i` is an integer initialized to `8`.
   - `p` is a pointer to an integer.
   - `q` is a pointer to a pointer to an integer.
   - `r` is a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to an integer.

2. **Pointer Assignments:**
   ```c
   p = &i;
   ```
   - `p` now points to the address of `i`. So, `*p` is `i`, which is `8`.

3. **Incrementing `i` Through `p`:**
   ```c
   (*p)++;
   ```
   - This increments the value of `i` by `1`.
   - Now, `i = 9`.

4. **Assign `p` to `q`:**
   ```c
   q = &p;
   ```
   - `q` now points to `p`. So, `*q` is `p`, and `**q` is `i`, which is `9`.

5. **Incrementing `i` Again Through `q`:**
   ```c
   (**q)++;
   ```
   - This increments the value of `i` by `1` again.
   - Now, `i = 10`.

6. **Assign `q` to `r`:**
   ```c
   r = &q;
   ```
   - `r` now points to `q`. So, `*r` is `q`, `**r` is `p`, and `***r` is `i`, which is `10`.

7. **Printing the Values:**
   ```c
   printf("%d %d %d %d\n", *p, **q, ***r, i);
   ```
   - `*p` is `i`, which is `10`.
   - `**q` is `i`, which is `10`.
   - `***r` is `i`, which is `10`.
   - `i` is `10`.

### Final Output:
Since all of these expressions (`*p`, `**q`, `***r`, and `i`) refer to the same value, which is `10`, the output will be:

```
10 10 10 10
```

This result reflects the final value of `i` after the increments done through the pointers `p` and `q`.
